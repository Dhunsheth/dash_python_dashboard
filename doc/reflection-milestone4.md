## Milestone 4 - Reflection
The initial version of our app was not the most user-friendly, but as we developed subsequent versions, its usability improved dramatically. The first version featured all content on a single page, requiring users to scroll through to view different plots. At the time, this layout seemed to be intuitive to us, likely because we were its creators. However, feedback from users provided a fresh perspective, revealing that a tabular design was preferable. This feedback led to a comprehensive overhaul of the app's main structure and theme. While this overhaul introduced some minor features, its primary goal was to enhance user-centricity. We believe these modifications have made our dashboard both easy to use and enjoyable to interact with.

If there was a recurring theme in our development process, it would likely be our efforts to understand the users' needs and how to construct a dashboard that simplifies meeting those needs. Our team members hail from technical backgrounds in computer science, engineering, and natural language processing (NLP). While this expertise was extremely beneficial for developing the functional capabilities of our app, it posed challenges in understanding what a non-technical user might seek in a dashboard. Fortunately, the peer review process illuminated these issues, enabling our group to incorporate the suggestions and steer our development towards a more user-centric approach.

As previously mentioned, the feedback we received led to some impactful changes in our app, including one suggestion that significantly shifted our approach. In the first version of our app, we allowed users to select any date range they desired from a calendar UI for display in the visualizations. This choice was made from a data scientist's perspective, as we assumed that, if we were using the app, we would appreciate the capability to manipulate the data as we wished. However, after receiving feedback, our peers indicated that this date selector was somewhat confusing. Upon further inspection and consideration, we concluded that this feature did not add any functionality to the app but instead made the UI feel cluttered and cumbersome. Taking our peers' advice, we changed the date selector to a monthly format. This shift in viewpoint proved to be critical in the development of the dashboard.
