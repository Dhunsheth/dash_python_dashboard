# Bike Share Dashboard Summary

The Bike Share Dashboard, addresses the crucial challenge of maintaining an optimal bike inventory for profitability in bike-sharing businesses. Commissioned by a Bike Sharing Organization (e.g., NABSA), the dashboard aims to provide insightful visualizations on key aspects, answering vital questions for effective operational management.

Motivation and Purpose:
The primary objective of the dashboard is to visualize the most popular times for bike rentals, categorized by hour of the day and month. Understanding the duration of rentals based on bike type (classic/electric) and identifying popular rental locations are integral components. The dashboard is designed to ensure the Bike Sharing Organization can meet the demand adequately, enhancing operational efficiency.

Research Questions:
The dashboard addresses three critical research questions:

**Peak Usage Times:** Identifying the most popular timeframes during the day and year for bike shares, anticipating commuting peaks and seasonal trends.
**Duration Analysis:** Investigating the duration of trips based on ride type (electric/classic) to determine user preferences.
**Station Popularity:** Analyzing the popularity of stations for both starting and ending bike shares, facilitating inventory management and relocation strategies to meet demand effectively.    

The Bike Sharing Dashboard serves as a valuable tool for the Bike Sharing Organization to make data-driven decisions, optimize inventory management, and enhance user experience in the dynamic and competitive bike-sharing industry.
